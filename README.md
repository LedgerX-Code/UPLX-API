# What is UPLX
UPLX is a blockchain powered health data network designed to securely record and store patient consultation, prescription and treatment data. Data recorded in UPLX is securely anonymized using blockchain encryption methodology, enabling unprecedented access to patient data without exposing patient identity and confidentiality. UPLX is designed to be interoperable and easily integrated with any hospital system via API or data entry process.

# What is API
An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.

# UPLX API
UPLX data operations is divided into two phases, **WRITE** and **READ** phase. 
* **WRITE phase** enables medical institutions to record patient information via API integration to HIS (Hospital Information Systems) or EMR (Electronic Medical Record) systems or via manual integration using database extraction or excel files. Data recorded during Write phase is encrypted and anonymized using blockchain private and public key infrastructure. Anonymizing patient data is the process of removing personal identity information such as patient name, NRIC or passport. 
* **READ phase** enables recorded data to be accessed by third parties to perform various data analytics such as big data analytics, machine learning and even AI. Read access to the UPLX network is provided via API integration. Secure API keys are provided to third parties for them to perform read operations of various stages of anonymized patient data.

This combination of **Write** and **Read** operations allows almost real-time access to patient data and enables medical institutions to perform data analytics and inference on a daily basis, on ever changing medical conditions. Developers can build their own application or program to interact with UPLX platform via API to read or write data.

# UPLX Write API
Will be released in future. Please stay tuned.

# UPLX Read API
Currently there 4 read APIs: 
- [Get Patient Detail](https://beta.cryptoestate.net/apidoc/)
- [Get prescription detail](https://beta.cryptoestate.net/apidoc/)
- [Get consultation detail](https://beta.cryptoestate.net/apidoc/)
- [Get List Of Patient](https://beta.cryptoestate.net/apidoc/)


# API Guidelines
This guideline can be implemented in various programming language. In this document, there are four example of implementation of UPLX API :
