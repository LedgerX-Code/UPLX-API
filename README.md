# What is UPLX
UPLX is a blockchain powered health data network designed to securely record and store patient consultation, prescription and treatment data. Data recorded in UPLX is securely anonymized using blockchain encryption methodology, enabling unprecedented access to patient data without exposing patient identity and confidentiality. UPLX is designed to be interoperable and easily integrated with any hospital system via API or data entry process.

# What is API
An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.
